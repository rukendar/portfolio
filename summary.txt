You initialized a new Git repository in your portfolio directory using git init. Next, you configured your global Git user identity by setting your name to "rukendar" and email to "minturukendar1432@gmail.com" with git config --global. You staged all files in the directory using git add . and created your first commit with the message "first commit" via git commit -m. You added the GitHub repository as the remote origin with git remote add origin https://github.com/rukendar/portfolio.git. After checking that your local branch was named "master" (not "main"), you pushed the changes to the remote master branch using git push -u origin master, successfully uploading your files and setting up tracking.
