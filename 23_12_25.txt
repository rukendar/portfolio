This Flask code creates a simple web application that shows a motivational quote on a webpage. It first loads an API key from a .env file and uses it to call the API Ninjas Quotes API. The get_quote() function sends a request to the API, receives a quote in JSON format, and extracts the quote text, author name, and category. When a user opens the home page (/), the app calls this function and displays the quote details using the ai_quote.html template. The app also has an About page that shows a simple message and an Index page that loads another HTML template. Every time the home page is refreshed, the app fetches a new quote from the API and displays it.
